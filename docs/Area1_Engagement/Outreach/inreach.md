## TOPS Collaborations Within NASA

The following are key elements of TOPS' strategy for engagement within the NASA community or TOPS' "inreach" strategy.

### Communities of Practice

A community of practice is defined as a group of people who share a craft or a profession, in this case, those participating in or advocating for open-source science within and outside of NASA. To develop a community of practice in NASA, TOPS will build awareness and acceptance of the benefits of collaborative open-source science. Our team will:
 - Create a vibrant digital community through GitHub
 - Create an informative email list
 - Provide updates using social media
 - Share success stories and co-develop articles that share open science wins
 - Support the development of [Space Apps Challenges](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org) by:
    - Proposing challenge ideas as they relate to Open Science, the Year of Open Science, and other relevant scientific topics
    - Promoting Space Apps through our outlets such as the TOPS newsletter, community forums, and our LinkedIn page
    - Promoting the Open Science curriculum and assisting with metrics tracking of shared links
 - Engage with NASA's Minority University Research and Engagement Program (MUREP)
 - Engage stakeholders through the [ESIP Open Source Science Transformation Cluster](https://wiki.esipfed.org/Open_Science_Cluster)

### TOPS Champions

TOPS Champions are open science ambassadors and subject matter experts that are present at 5 NASA centers. These individuals include scientists, staff, thought-leaders, and YOU! We can't build a robust community without your help. If you are interested in becoming a TOPS Champion, [contact us](mailto:hq-openscience@mail.nasa.gov) and [join our email list](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/signup/)!
