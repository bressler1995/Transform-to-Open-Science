# Outreach

To reach the broadest of communities, our TOPS team seeks to form equitable partnerships with academic institutions, non-profits, professional societies, and other government agencies.

Here are some ways we collaborate and communicate with communities:

 - [Host community forums](/docs/Area1_Engagement/Community_Forums/readme.md)
 - Participate in webinars at community meetings
 - [Co-develop open science curricula](/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/Open-Science-101/readme.md)
 - Create an online [forum](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/discussions) to encourage conversations from diverse voices/perspectives
 - Co-create articles of success
 - Develop podcast with the Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS), a technical society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
 - Collaborate with communities focused on historically underrepresented groups

If you and members of your community are interested in collaborating with TOPS, please [contact us](hq-openscience@mail.nasa.gov).
