# Online Community Strategy

The following describes the Transform to Open Science (TOPS) team's strategy and proposed process for building an online community. 


## TOPS Slack

TOPS Slack is used for project coordination among NASA civil servants and scientists already involved in open science at NASA, and by collaborators such as the Open Science 101 SMEs and TOPS panel members.

The TOPS Slack is primarily used to share the date, time, and location of open science events occurring at NASA and beyond. As such, Slack is utilized primarily as a coordination and information-sharing platform, and is not being actively used for reinforcing and building community.

## General Community Building Tips

Preliminary online research suggests the following about building an online community:
* Diverse content is needed. An online space must have “more than blog posts,” and invite newcomers to engage with content beyond reading. Polls and moderated discussions can help create a collaborative atmosphere. Here are some [suggestions](https://community.mightynetworks.com/posts/free-guide-1k-great-community-questions?ai=60a4ec40-079b-4465-aa8d-8a1a2780406e&_ga=2.39007715.1977069232.1660244631-20294202.1660244631) for discussion questions.
* The online space should have a “year in the life” plan, that includes a full calendar of how members can engage with the community. Monthly themes and detailed, weekly calendars can assist with this. 
* The space must be actively moderated by someone with the ability to hide and remove content, as well as flag those violating the code of conduct. 
* Individuals like to have an understanding of their role in the community. Point folks to how they can engage individually, as well as members of other organized groups. Part of this is understanding the type of person who is going to put energy into engaging with the online content that is being created. 
* Collaboration since the start of the pandemic has been continually evolving. Facilitation and community-building needs to be aware of the changes taking place and adapt accordingly. TOPS will attempt to stay current on best practices for remote and distributed collaboration, including: designing remote meetings, determining participation guidelines, and developing interaction platforms (e.g., shared notes).
