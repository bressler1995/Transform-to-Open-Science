# TOPS Open Science Curriculum: Open Science 101

[Transform to Open Science (TOPS)](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science) is part of NASA’s [Open-Source Science Initiative,](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/open-science/) which is making a long-term commitment to create a scientific culture that is ready for 21st century challenges.

To support everyone's path to a more open and equitable scientific future, TOPS has created an Open Science 101 (OS101) curriculum. The curriculum aims to introduce learners to a nuanced understanding of open science, enabling participants to actively participate in open science. The five modules introduce participants to the definitions, tools, and resources available to share their research process and products more openly.

The curriculum is available on the [NASA TOPS Github site](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/) and can be taken as a massive open online course (MOOC). NASA TOPS Open Science 101 was developed by the [global open science community](./curriculum_leads.md) to help everyone learn the key practical skills and useful tools that help us all work openly together.

Content for the Open Science 101 is being derived from several amazing resources, including: [OpenSciency](https://github.com/opensciency/), [OpenbyDesign](https://github.com/DSI-CORES/OpenByDesign/tree/master/src), [Utrecht](https://openscience-utrecht.com/what-is-open-science/), [Mozilla](https://mozillascience.github.io/study-group-orientation/4-open-research101.html), and more....

## Learning Objectives

Open Science 101 aims to introduce learners to a nuanced understanding of open science, enabling participants to better understand an open science workflow from end to end. The focus of the curriculum will be on providing learners with a basic understanding of open science, its ethos and benefits, and how to actively participate in open science communities. The TOPS curriculum will also be used to support researchers looking to engage with NASA as NASA moves to adopt more open science requirements (e.g., Scientific Information Policy and ROSES opportunities). Scientists will need to acquire the new skills highlighted in the curriculum to participate in open science effectively and to demonstrate those skills when applying for NASA funding opportunities.
