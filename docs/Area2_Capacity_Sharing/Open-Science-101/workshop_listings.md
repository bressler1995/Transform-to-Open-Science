# Workshop Listing Requirements

TOPS offers the option to take Open Science 101 modules at workshops in both virtual and in-person formats.  This allows participants the benefit of getting trained through an instructor while taking availability into account. To facilitate signups, we have built a system through which instructors can list workshop and training dates on our website. Likewise, we encourage all instructors to request that their workshop details be listed [on this page](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/take-os101/).

## General Requirements

These requirements apply to both in person and virtual instructor-led workshops that wish to be listed on the TOPS website.

* Your workshop must be free of charge.
* You must have funding from NASA (for example: TOPST).
* If you have not been provided with a registration page or registration information page, you are expected to create your own.
* You must clear your listing with TOPS by emailing [hq-openscience@nasa.gov](mailto:hq-openscience@nasa.gov) even if you would prefer to list your workshop through the steps outlined in our [website documentation](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/website#os101-workshops).

## Virtual Workshop Requirements

Below are the details that TOPS will ask for when you request your virtual workshop(s) be listed on our website:

* Date(s) of the workshop.
* The time(s) that the workshop will take place with the time zone.
  * For example: 4:00 - 5:00 PM EST
* The type of workshop.
  * This should be a general description (a few words) that best describes the workshop, and other useful information such as your organization name or the name of the conference.  For example "TOPST Summer School - My Org Name" or "Conference Workshop - AAS" would be great event type examples.
* The topic(s) of the workshop.
  * This is usually an OS 101 module such as "OS101 Module 2".
* The instructor(s) and their affiliation.
  * For example "John Doe, NASA".
* Whether your workshop is internal to NASA or JPL.
  * Only contractors and employees will be able to attend these types of workshops.
* Whether your workshop is using a registration form from an external service.
* A link to your registration page or information.

## In-Person Workshop Requirements

Below are the details that TOPS will ask for when you request your in-person workshop(s) be listed on our website.  All the details for virtual workshops apply to in-person workshops. The only exception is that a location is required for in-person workshops:

* The location of the workshop.
  * This includes the city name and the venue name.  An example of this is "Moscone Center, San Francisco, CA".

## Adding a Workshop to the TOPS Website Yourself

Once your request is cleared with TOPS, you can allow us to take care of adding your workshop(s) to the website on your behalf. This will be communicated to our GitHub Lead.

If you have experience with GitHub and creating Pull Requests, you can optionally choose to add the workshop(s) yourself, and the GitHub Lead will help you merge it in.  You can find instructions on how to do this [here](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/website#os101-workshops).
