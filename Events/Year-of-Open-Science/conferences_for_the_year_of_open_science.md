# Year of Open Science Conference Participation

With the White House declaring 2023 as the Year of Open Science, the NASA Transform to Open Science (TOPS)  team will be participating in conferences across the nation (and internationally) to encourage the wider scientific community to join us in promoting, strengthening, and engaging with open science.

Proposals for TOPS attendance at open science conferences can be submitted, tailored to your organizational and audience needs. Our engagement opportunities offer a range of options, including open science-themed collateral, NASA TOPS Booths, and Workshops. While we cannot guarantee acceptance, we welcome your proposals for consideration.
