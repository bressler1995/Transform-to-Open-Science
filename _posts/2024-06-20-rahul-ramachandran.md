Most people use tools at work, whether it's a hammer, a pencil, or a computer. Very few seek a doctorate degree in creating new tools for the job.

Using that degree to make it easier for people around the world to access and use the vast amounts of data gathered by NASA? Well, that might just be unheard of if you didn't know someone like Rahul Ramachandran, a senior research scientist in the Earth Science branch at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center.

"My undergrad was in mechanical engineering. I wanted to do industrial engineering, so I came to the U.S. for that, but I didn't like the field that much," Ramachandran explained. "It was by chance somebody suggested meteorology."

That led him to learn about atmospheric science as well, but it was the 1990s and the technology of the time was very limiting. So, Ramachandran set out to learn more about computers and how to better analyze data.
