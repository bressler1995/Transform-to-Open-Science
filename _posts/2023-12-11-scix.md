The launch of the Science Explorer (SciX) at the upcoming American Geophysical Union conference marks a significant leap in open science discovery. This new literature portal, an expansion of the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS), is set to revolutionize how science is found, accessed, and utilized. The beta release, accessible at SciXplorer.org starting December 11, is a testament to NASAâ€™s commitment to open science.

### The Origin of SciX

Back in 2019, NASA's Science Mission Directorate envisioned an interdisciplinary literature portal that would span across its divisions (Earth Science, Planetary Science, Astrophysics, Heliophysics, and Biological and Physical Sciences), bolstering open science. The ADS, with its decades long support for open science goals facilitating discovery and dissemination of open access publications, data, and software by aggregating and linking them, was the natural choice for this expansion. This initiative was more than just creating a repository; it was about weaving a digital tapestry that connects publications, data, and software in a meaningful and accessible way.
