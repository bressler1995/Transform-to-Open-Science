Students at NASA's Office of the Chief Science Data Officer (OCSDO) are working to promote open science during the summer 2024 internship session. Their projects fall across a variety of areas, including user experience, policy, and DEIA (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility).

## Lena Young: Increasing DEIA Engagement

Lena Young, a doctoral candidate in the Creative Leadership for Innovation and Change program at the University of the Virgin Islands in St. Thomas, envisions equitable space societies 100 – 300 years in the future as part of her dissertation. Her NASA internship project involves researching ways to make science more accessible for different groups and interacting with NASA leadership to assess how well they are engaging historically underserved or excluded communities.

Young also worked with her mentors to find overlap between her internship project and her PhD work as a futurist. "In 30 years, once NASA has achieved their goals, what would open science look like?" Young said. "I want to see what different futures I can create for open science and DEIA engagement."

## Becca Michelson: Advancing Policy

Becca Michelson has a passion for increasing the availability of scientific information. A soon-to-be-graduate in physics and astronomy from Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, she was drawn to an internship role in researching the current state of open science policy for the OCSDO. By understanding the challenges and opportunities in this area, she’s helping NASA better support researchers in making their science accessible to all.

"Open science makes this a more inclusive field, where if I'm an early career scientist, I can build on the science that other people who are experts in the field have done," Michelson said. In the future, she hopes to implement open science principles into her own research in astronomy, drawing from the best practices she has learned at NASA.
