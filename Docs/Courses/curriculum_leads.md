## OS101 TOPS Curriculum Development 2022

These Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) are a global representation of Open Science experts. They contributed significantly to the early content of OS101, and created the online book [Opensciency - A core open science curriculum by and for the research community](https://opensciency.github.io/sprint-content/), from which some of the OS101 content was adapted. Discover why these SMEs practice open science on the [Open Science Stories page](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/docs/Area1_Engagement/Open-Science-Stories/SME_Why-I-Practice-Open-Science.md).
