# Open Science Curriculum Structure

Open Science 101 is designed to introduce NASA-funded scientists or future NASA-funded scientists to the benefits and principles of open science such that they can upskill and continue collaborating with NASA science activities. The Open Science 101 curriculum will help participants gain an understanding of the open science ethos and workflow, show participants the tools needed to follow an open science process and thus actively participate in open science communities, and help to familiarize participants with the benefits of open science to their research and beyond.
