# Module 1: The Ethos of Open Science

Welcome to this introductory module on open science. Open Science is the principle and practice of making research products and processes available to all, while respecting diverse cultures, maintaining security and privacy, and fostering collaborations, reproducibility, and equity. In this module, you take a closer look at what open science is, the current landscape as well as the benefits and challenges. You then get a glimpse into the practice of open science, including a case study. To start your journey with open science, you are presented with actions that you can take starting today, such as exploring communities that you can engage with.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, participants will be able to:
- Explain what open science is, why it's a good thing to do, and list some of the benefits and challenges of open science adoption.
- Describe the practice of open science, including considerations when writing a management plan and the tasks in the “Use, Make, Share” framework.
- Evaluate available options when determining whether research products should or should not be open.
- List ways to connect with others who are part of the open science community.

### Lesson 1: What is Open Science?
 In this lesson, you take a closer look at what open science means, including the intended goals and outcomes of adopting open science as an individual and as part of a larger community. You then review examples of open science in action. Finally, you wrap up the lesson by taking a closer look at why adopting open science is needed.

### Lesson 2: Why is Open Science important? 
In this lesson, you learn how adopting open science benefits you as a researcher and society. You also learn about some of the challenges and hurdles with using open science principles and how to navigate them.

### Lesson 3: How to do Open Science: 
This lesson introduces important security and privacy considerations for scientists when sharing information. Next, the lesson discusses how sharing information may impact different communities. Following this, the lesson explains the topic of intellectual property, how it can be protected, and the different types of licenses available to facilitate sharing while ensuring the owner of the information receives credit for their work. Lastly, this covers the effect of rules and regulations set by an organization, grant, or publisher on a scientist's options to make their research open access.

### Lesson 4: When Not to Be Open: 
In this lesson, you will consider potential barriers to adopting open science practices. Barriers can come in the form of personal fears, as a result of misaligned social challenges, or institutional/infrastructure barriers. We begin with an exercise to identify your own concerns or fears around adopting open science. This leads into a discussion about common barriers and mitigation strategies.

### Lesson 5: Planning for Open Science: From Theory to Practice: 
This module is nearly over, but there’s so much more information available about open science – so our last lesson is for everyone who wants to learn more. In this lesson, you review ways to start your journey with open science including a list of resources that you can use now.
