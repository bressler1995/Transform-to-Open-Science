# Module 2: Open Tools & Resources

This module is designed to help you get started on your journey to practicing open science. It offers an introductory view of the concepts and resources that are fundamental to open science. The bridge between the concepts and the practice of the concepts is something called the use, make, share framework. There are many methods and models that define how to get started with open science. The use, make, share framework was constructed to help you immediately assign purpose to the concepts and tools that are covered in this module as well as in the entire Open Science 101 curriculum. All of the information that you learn here will be addressed in more detail as you participate in other modules but can also be applied immediately after completing this module.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you should be able to:
- Define the foundational elements of open science, which includes research products, the “Use, Make, Share” framework, and the role of an Open Science and Data Management Plan.
- List and explain the purpose of resources used to discover and assess research products for reuse, including repositories, search portals, publications, documentation such as README files, metadata, and licensing.
- Develop a high-level strategy for making and sharing data that employs the FAIR principles, incorporates a data management plan, tracks data and authors with persistent identifiers and citations, and utilizes the appropriate data formats and tools for making data and sharing results.
- Describe the software lifecycle and design a high-level strategy for making and sharing software that considers the the use of a software management plan, the tools needed for development including source code, kernels, programming languages, third-party software and version control, and the tools and documentation used for publishing and curating open software.
- List the resources for sharing research products including preprints, open access publications, reference management systems, and resources to support reproducibility.

### Lesson 1: Introduction to Process of Open Science: 
In this lesson you review the definition of open science and several other common terms including research products, data, software, and results. In addition, you will read examples that demonstrate how these open science tools are used in practice. The lesson wraps up with an example of how one group openly shared their data, results, software, and paper.

### Lesson 2: General Tools for Open Science: 
This lesson introduces you to the commonly used tools in open science. It starts out by providing a brief introduction to open science tools and describes persistent identifiers - one of the most common open science tools in use that ensures reproducibility, accessibility, and recognition of scientific products. This is followed by descriptions of other common open science tools that are applicable regardless of your field of study. The lesson wraps up with a description of open science and data management plans that is a key component to sharing your science throughout the research process.

### Lesson 3: Tools for Open Data: 
This lesson discusses the concepts, considerations, and tools for making data and results. It starts with a closer look at the FAIR principles and how they apply to data. The lesson includes an introduction to plans, tools, data formats, and other considerations that are related to making data and sharing the results related to that data.

### Lesson 4: Tools for Open Code: 
This lesson introduces you to some useful tools for working with open code. You will learn the various tools available to develop, store, and share open code, from version control to code editing software to containers.

### Lesson 5: Tools for Open Results:
This lesson focuses on the tools available for sharing research products. It begins with a discussion of the tools for management of research projects. Then it introduced the tools for open publications and how to find them. Next, this lesson discusses the tools for open results. Lastly, this lesson discusses the concept of reproducibility. Journals are a tool for sharing your results and these are discussed in more detail in Module 5 - Open Results.
