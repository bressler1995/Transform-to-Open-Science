# Where do I find NASA's openly available data?

As of December 2022, the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) has a one-stop shop for all NASA science data: [the science data portal](https://science.data.nasa.gov/). To learn about domain-specific archives, or go straight to the data portal and begin exploring please refer to [this curated list](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science-Book/Proposal_Resources/NASA_open_data.html).
