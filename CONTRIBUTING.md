# Contributing to Our GitHub

The goal of this page is to provide a comprensive guide for community members to contribute to TOPS documentation, the Open Science 101 curriculum, and any other topic pertaining to TOPS and Open Science.

Before contributing, please read our [License](./LICENSE.md) and our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Code of Conduct
The [TOPS code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) is a great guide for interacting with our community and contributing to our repository content in a respectful and professional manner.

## Types of Contributors

Depending on your level of interaction with TOPS and the TOPS GitHub, contributors can be defined as: 
- A **community member**: anyone in the open science community who visits a TOPS site, utilizes TOPS online tools, or attends a TOPS event.
- A **participant**: anyone who posts a comment or poses a question in the *GitHub Discussion Space*, reports a site bug or requests a new resource in *GitHub Issues*, or attends a TOPS event and utilizes any virtual chat features during that event. 
- A **contributor**: anyone who forks this GitHub repository and submits pull requests to make additions or changes to the posted content.


## Methods of Contributing
There are three, major ways to contribute to the TOPS GitHub. 
- **[Discussions](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/discussions)** - Our GitHub discussions community is intended for general Q&A, sharing Open Science stories, and having in depth conversations about open science related topics. 
  - To learn more about GitHub Discussions check out GitHub's [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions) 
- **[Issues](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/issues)** - Suggest content changes, additions, or deletions. Issues can be related to any content found on this repository, and training material such as Open Science 101. 
     - Before submitting a new [issue](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/issues), check to make sure [a similar issue isn't already open](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue). If one is, contribute to that issue thread with your feedback.
     - When submitting a bug report, please try to provide as much detail as possible, i.e. a screenshot or [gist](https://gist.github.com/) that demonstrates the problem, the technology you are using, and any relevant links.
- **[Pull Requests](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/pulls)** (and forks) - Directly contribute to TOPS repository content using your favorite code editor and a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
  - For more information on contributing to a repository using a fork and pull requests, [visit here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project).
  - TOPS has made [a video](https://youtu.be/PHoScPeMWHI) demononstrating the pull request flow.
  - It is suggested that you work from a feature branch if you are making substantial changes.  Learn more about branches [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches).
  - **Important:** Make sure you keep your fork up to date before making a Pull Request to avoid merge conflicts. There are various methods to do this using git, the GitHub CLI, or GiHub's web interface [as described here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork).

## Contributing to Open Science 101

All of the methods described apply to contributions for the Open Science 101 curriculum.  The curriculum content exists on [our Open Science 101 branch](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/open-science-101).  When opening a Pull Request, Issue or Discussion, please refer to [the content](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/open-science-101) on this branch.

Direct links to the content in question or screenshots are helpful details to provide so that our dispositioning process can be as efficient as possible.
