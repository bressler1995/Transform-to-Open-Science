# Incentives for Open Science

The current incentive structure in science is largely based on publications and citations. In open science, we are working to acknowledge the many different aspects of science and research that are essential to scientific advancement, such as writing code, managing data, mentoring students, etc. By embracing open science principles and practices, scientists and researchers can increase the impact of their scientific efforts. Incentives for open science are an active area of development, and TOPS and NASA are contributing to additional incentives to facilitate the transition to a more open scientific ecosystem.

## NASA Open Science Funding Opportunities

While the TOPST solicitation **has come to a close**, you can visit the [NASA webpage for open science funding opportunities](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/open-science/nasa-open-science-funding-opportunities/). Please check the web page for the latest information about these solicitations.

### TOPST

TOPST was a ROSES a solicitation that has since passed the deadline for proposal submissions.  You can learn more about our group of TOPST grantees [here](./TOPST.md).

### Open Science Data Management Plans

To encourage a transition to open science practices, ROSES solicitations will be requiring an Open Science Data Management plan (OSDMP).  You can learn more about OSDMPs by [taking our Open Science 101 course](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/take-os101/).
