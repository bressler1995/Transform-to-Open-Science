# TOPS Training Solicitation

Transform to Open Science Training or "TOPST" was a Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Science (ROSES) solicitation.

### The TOPST element solicited proposals for:

1. The development of the ScienceCore, a discipline specific scientific use cases curriculum
2. Implementation of Summer Schools to teach Open Science 101
3. Implementation of Virtual Cohorts to complete Open Science 101

The training material and learning activities should be targeted to audiences from undergraduate students to established scientists and managers from all science disciplines supported by NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD). More information on the ScienceCore is available [here](../Trainings#sciencecore) and on the Open Science 101 is available [here](../Trainings#open-science-101).

## Proposal Elements

TOPST required both an **Open-Source Science Development Plan** (replaces the Data Management Plan) and an **Equal Access Plan**. More information on these elements is available [here](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science-Book/TOPST/TOPST_proposal_elements.html).
