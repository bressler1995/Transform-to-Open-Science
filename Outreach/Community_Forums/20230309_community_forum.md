# March TOPS Community Forum #

Thank you for joining us March 09, 2023 for a joint community forum between the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) SEA Change, Creative Commons, and TOPS, Open Science: Challenges and Opportunities for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. In the forum we will introduce the three organizations and then openly discuss what is open science in higher education institutions, how can learning to practice open science encourage equity across the entire STEMM enterprise, and how do we ensure that voices from traditional underrepresented geographical regions are not only included but prioritized?
