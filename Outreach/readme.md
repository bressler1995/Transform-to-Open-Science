# Outreach

Open Science is built on community. Parallel to the core values of Open Science, NASA’s Transform to Open Science (TOPS) efforts can’t be successful without working with diverse communities, agencies, institutions, and disciplines. When we learn from each other, we become stronger together.

In reaching a diverse range of individuals, TOPS aims to spread awareness about Open Science, how it can seemlessly be utilized in research, and how it can foster a culture of diversity, accessibility, and equity.

Our methodologies for achieving these goals consist of the following:

## Webinars

TOPS on occassion hosts special topic webinars that can be organized into two groups:

- [Community Panels](./Community_Panels)
  - TOPS Community Panels bring together leaders from the open science, open source software, and data science communities with the NASA TOPS team for a detailed review of TOPS plans. These meetinging will be public and have a mechanism for the public to submit questions.
- [Community Forums](./Community_Forums)
  - TOPS Community Forums are public meetings where we discuss the TOPS initiative, open science activities from special guests, and open science at large. We try to make these sessions interactive, with plenty of room for questions and discussions. Come join us! Public participation always encouraged!

## TOPS Newsletter

[Join the TOPS email list](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/signup/) to hear about open science activities, stories, news, and funding opportunities.

## Podcasts
Below are examples of podcasts that TOPS has collaborated on to promote Open Science.

- [Down to Earth Podcast (GRSS and IEEE)](https://www.grss-ieee.org/down-to-earth-podcast/)
- [Small Steps Giant Leaps](https://www.nasa.gov/podcasts/small-steps-giant-leaps/small-steps-giant-leaps-episode-129-accelerating-discoveries-with-open-science/)
- [NASA's Curious Universe](https://www.nasa.gov/podcasts/curious-universe/how-open-science-and-ai-are-advancing-hurricane-research/)

## Conferences

TOPS will build capacity for practicing open science by [attending scientific conferences](/docs/Area1_Engagement/Outreach/tops_conferences.md) across the nation.

## Outreach Within NASA
Just as it is very important to spread awareness of Open Science to the broader research community, it is also very important to spread awareness and develop relationships within NASA. 

### Communities of Practice
A community of practice is defined as a group of people who share a craft or a profession, in this case, those participating in or advocating for open-source science within and outside of NASA. To develop a community of practice in NASA, TOPS will build awareness and acceptance of the benefits of collaborative open-source science. Our team will:
- Create a vibrant digital community through GitHub
- Create an informative email list
- Provide updates using social media
- Share success stories and co-develop articles that share open science wins
- Develop 3 [Space Apps Challenges](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org) centered around:
  - Proposing challenge ideas as they relate to Open Science, the Year of Open Science, and other relevant scientific topics
  - Promoting Space Apps through our outlets such as the TOPS newsletter, community forums, and our LinkedIn page
  - Promoting the Open Science curriculum and assisting with metrics tracking of shared links
- Engage with NASA’s Minority University Research and Engagement Program (MUREP)
- Engage stakeholders through the [ESIP Open Source Science Transformation Cluster](https://wiki.esipfed.org/Open_Science_Cluster)

### TOPS Champions

TOPS Champions are NASA civil servants and contractors that are present at 6 NASA centers. They serve as open science ambassadors and subject matter experts.

### Citizen Science

The TOPS initiative is working with the Citizen Science program at NASA.  To learn more about Citizen Science at NASA, [learn more here](https://science.nasa.gov/citizen-science/).
