# Outreach

Open Science is built on community. Parallel to the core values of Open Science, NASA’s Transform to Open Science (TOPS) efforts can’t be successful without working with diverse communities, agencies, institutions, and disciplines. When we learn from each other, we become stronger together.

In reaching a diverse range of individuals, TOPS aims to spread awareness about Open Science, how it can seemlessly be utilized in research, and how it can foster a culture of diversity, accessibility, and equity.

Our methodologies for achieving these goals consist of the following:

## Webinars

TOPS on occassion hosts special topic webinars that can be organized into two groups:

- [Community Panels](./Community_Panels)
  - TOPS Community Panels bring together leaders from the open science, open source software, and data science communities with the NASA TOPS team for a detailed review of TOPS plans. These meetinging will be public and have a mechanism for the public to submit questions.
- [Community Forums](./Community_Forums)
  - TOPS Community Forums are public meetings where we discuss the TOPS initiative, open science activities from special guests, and open science at large. We try to make these sessions interactive, with plenty of room for questions and discussions. Come join us! Public participation always encouraged!

## TOPS Newsletter

[Join the TOPS email list](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/signup/) to hear about open science activities, stories, news, and funding opportunities.

### Past Newsletter Releases
For a preview of our content from our email list, feel free to read our [past newsletter releases](../TOPS_Newsletter/).

## Podcasts
Below are examples of podcasts that TOPS has collaborated on to promote Open Science.

- [Down to Earth Podcast (GRSS and IEEE)](https://www.grss-ieee.org/down-to-earth-podcast/)

## Conferences

TOPS will build capacity for practicing open science by [attending scientific conferences](/docs/Area1_Engagement/Outreach/tops_conferences.md) across the nation.

## Outreach Within NASA
Just as it is very important to spread awareness of Open Science to the broader research community, it is also very important to spread awareness and develop relationships within NASA. 

### Communities of Practice
A community of practice is defined as a group of people who share a craft or a profession, in this case, those participating in or advocating for open-source science within and outside of NASA. To develop a community of practice in NASA, TOPS will build awareness and acceptance of the benefits of collaborative open-source science. Our team will:
- Create a vibrant digital community through GitHub
- Create an informative email list
- Provide updates using social media
- Share success stories and co-develop articles that share open science wins
- Develop 3 [Space Apps Challenges](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org) centered around:
  - Proposing challenge ideas as they relate to Open Science, the Year of Open Science, and other relevant scientific topics
  - Promoting Space Apps through our outlets such as the TOPS newsletter, community forums, and our LinkedIn page
  - Promoting the Open Science curriculum and assisting with metrics tracking of shared links
- Engage with NASA’s Minority University Research and Engagement Program (MUREP)
- Engage stakeholders through the [ESIP Open Source Science Transformation Cluster](https://wiki.esipfed.org/Open_Science_Cluster)

### TOPS Champions

TOPS Champions are open science ambassadors and subject matter experts that are present at 5 NASA centers. These individuals include scientists, staff, thought-leaders, and YOU! We can't build a robust community without your help. If you are interested in becoming a TOPS Champion, contact us and join our email list!

## Citizen Science
We realize that the road to making open science a reality doesn’t begin and end with academics and NASA scientists. We want to reach science-interested populations too! Citizen science provides an opportunity for the general science-interested public to get involved with scientific research to address societal needs, particularly those at a regional or local level, and to advance innovation. In citizen science, community members “formulate research questions, conduct scientific experiments, collect and analyze data, interpret results, make new discoveries, develop technologies and applications, and solve complex problems."

NASA has been engaged in numerous citizen science projects across SMD and this is another exciting opportunity to do more!

NASA TOPS will promote the inclusion of citizen and participatory science as integral parts of open science policies and practices at the national and international levels through the following tactics. We will:

- Host webinars or listening sessions with the citizen science organizations
- Promote TOPS curricula across their organization/communities
- Highlight success stories around open science efforts
