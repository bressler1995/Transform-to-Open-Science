# Outreach

At the TOPS initiative, our main priority is to reach as many people as possible, from a multitude of agencies, insitutions, disciplines, and backgrounds. We want to spread awareness about Open Science, how it can be utilized in research, and likewise our Open Science trainings which provide even more incentive to learn about Open Science.  Our methods consist of the following:

## Webinars

TOPS on occassion hosts special topic webinars that can be organized into two groups:

- [Community Panels](./Community_Panels)
  - TOPS Community Panels bring together leaders from the open science, open source software, and data science communities with the NASA TOPS team for a detailed review of TOPS plans. These meetinging will be public and have a mechanism for the public to submit questions.
- [Community Forums](./Community_Forums)
  - TOPS Community Forums are public meetings where we discuss the TOPS initiative, open science activities from special guests, and open science at large. We try to make these sessions interactive, with plenty of room for questions and discussions. Come join us! Public participation always encouraged!
