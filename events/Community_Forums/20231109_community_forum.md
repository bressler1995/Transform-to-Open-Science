# November Special Topic Webinar 

Elevating Science Communication: Build a Better Poster Workshop

NASA's Transform to Open Science (TOPS) Special Topic Webinar with Dr. Mike Morrison, founder of #BetterPoster Movement. Dr. Morrison will lead an engaging virtual session with a distinctive approach to science communication using evidence-based design principles. This event is open to the public, so spread the word and be a part of this transformative conversation.

-  Q/A from Webinar

1. If you use a QR code do you link only the PDF, or a collection of paper, code and social links? Is there a best practice?
     
I use LinkTree to link to paper, data, and my socials. If you really want to do something magical I've seen people use ARQR, so you point your phone at the QR and get a 3D model floating in space in front of the poster.

2. Do you feel there should be two versions of a poster - the one for the conference and one for the deposit online or in conference proceedings that has more written detail?
   
Ideal/perfect world answer: Yes, different user context = different design. An ideal format for an online poster might be a short video and/or a "scroll story" PDF (think about scrolling through Apple's website, learning about the new iPhone one point/figure at a time). You can see examples of this in my cartoon on Virtual Posters. 

Realistic answer: just upload your billboard poster and your full abstract paper/preprint to the same repository page (Figshare, etc). So online skimmers get to skim your lightweight billboard poster, and then download the full paper when they want more detail.  

3. I applaud the #BetterPoster format but get a lot of pushback from scientists who want to know: are there any studies that document its effectiveness?(references please!) Thanks and good job!
 
#BetterPosters performed better in eye tracking, were rated as more accessible by conference attendees with accessibility needs, were rated as easier to interact with in two field studies, and there is at least no difference in 'number of stops' so far, and some evidence that #betterposters get more stops (if you remove on insane outlier in that AHA field study, #betterposters got more stops). You can also see a full list of background references that inform the design in the description to the #betterposter Generation 2 cartoon on YouTube.

We'll keep testing and iterating of course. Still lots to improve and lots of research left to be done. 

But keep in mind: If you're using the traditional 'wall of text' poster, you're not following the evidence right now. The traditional 'wall of text' poster design actively violates many best practices. Many people often don't realize how little evidence there is for the traditional poster design. This is not a situation of "newcomer vs. tried & tested". It's "new design that attempts to follow best practices" versus "traditional design that ignores best practices". 

The uncomfortable truth is that no poster design has really been proven effective, traditional or #betterposter. The best poster is still unknown, so try your best idea!

If you want to try these new poster approaches, but you're getting pushback, just use one of the Generation 2 #betterposter layouts (available on Open Science Framework here).They include more graphs and figures, which makes them feel more dense (which is what people usually push back on with the first #betterposter). The relative unknown-ness of the Generation 2 #betterposter layouts, together with the additional "density feeling" will be enough that people won't recognize your poster as that famous 'viral' layout and won't give you pushback, but you'll still get the benefits! These newer #betterposter layouts have gotten much, much less pushback. And even convinced some holdouts!

4. How long does it take you to prep e.g. a 15-min talk with graphs/graphics being displayed one element at at time?

If you already know what graphs/graphics you want, hiding and showing pieces of them to bring them on the screen one chunk at a time is pretty quick. You get good at just choosing an appear/disappear animation for everything. And many slides just use an invisible rectangle in powerpoint that's the same color as the background color that "covers" a given element then hides itself to reveal that part of the graph/whatever.

Once you get used to creating visual presentations, it'll feel as fast as jotting bullet points all over every slide. I'm sure if you timed it, I would spend more time than bullet-walls, but it feels faster because it's so much more fun and creative to do the visual presentations than writing all over every slide (to me). 

I have absolutely rushed visual presentations together in an hour before the talk starts. And I've also spent dozens of hours on a visual deck if it's for a keynote or job talk. 

But, it's not a question of my opinion/style here. If you don't invest a little extra time to show each element one at a time, your presentation will be harder to digest. If you do invest the extra time, it'll be easier and more engaging. But, sometimes you don't have the extra time, and some slides have to be a little less engaging. Totally cool. Note: Talking over one image is a good time hack.

5. How can complex concepts be effectively communicated through intuitive visual mapping in research without compromising the academic rigor and depth of the work?

Often the most intuitive visual is also the most precise and accurate. If you're destroying cancer cells, the best image isn't a just cartoon cancer cell being stabbed --- it's probably a blown up microscope image with some colorization to show what's happening. Remember the 'best' mask image in my example study was the photo taken in the actual lab --- not the stock photo.

But, I know there's often tension/tradeoffs between speed and depth. The hard answer here is that communicating concisely with necessary depth is a skill you have to build. I often see the grad students and newbie scientists write takeaways/use images that are too clickbaity or "salesy" or not rigorous enough. But topic experts can write incredibly efficient one-line takeaways, building in limitations with statements like "this happens if X is true" or "this interesting thing happened in a small sample".

6. Do we need to have a mind of a marketer or advertiser when making posters?

No, you need to have the mind of a poster designer when you design a poster. You're not selling your research. You're transmitting your research and helping people understand and remember it so they can use it to make discoveries faster, in a crowded room where everybody is overloaded already. You're not writing a paper and defending yourself to every possible reviewer question --- you're punching things into people's brains from 5 feet away to help people learn a lot from the whole session. That's a harder design problem than I realized until I started trying to fix it. 

That said, I think in science we're way too quick to be ashamed of "marketing methods". I've seen people write off betterposter entirely because "it feels like marketing." For the record, most of the research I cite is from the fields of instructional design and human factors. But, if we want attendees to learn and remember 100 new insights in a one-hour poster session, marketing probably has some good insights for us. I haven't used them yet, but I think it's silly and unscientific for us to ignore a whole field of relevant research just because we're allergic to the idea of using 'marketing' methods. We could probably learn a lot from marketing, applied in our own (more conservative, sober) way. 

7. I'm publishing a dataset. There is no key-finding that I want to communicate. What should my headline be?

Tell people what's in the dataset! Maybe showcase some interesting data points if they exist. Think about the order of what YOU would like to know to determine whether the dataset can help your research. Probably: What's in it? How many records? Enough to run ML on? PS - Thanks for publishing your data!!
