# April TOPS Community Forum #

Thank you for joining us April 13, 2023 for NASA’s Transform to Open Science [TOPS](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/) mission for a special community forum featuring two of NASA’s 2022 [Space Apps](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/) challenge winning teams who developed winning ideas using open data and tools from NASA and partner space agencies. This forum showcased [MIMBI](https://lucianosantiviago.github.io/MIMBI_eng/) and the [Open Metric](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-HNz4qqVG0TiwarHmm2TVAyv16u7qGH7?usp=sharing) team's projects and experiences. [Lisa Cuevas Shaw](https://www.cos.io/about/news/cos-welcomes-lisa-cuevas-shaw-as-coo-and-managing-director), [Center for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/) served as our special guest moderator and lead a short Q&A portion at the end. Interested in learning more about the winning teams: What is [MIMBI](https://2022.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/2022-challenges/steam/teams/mimbi/project) ("spark" in Guarani)? How can you [measure the impact of science on society](https://2022.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/2022-challenges/measuring-open-science/teams/the-open-metric/project)?
